How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?
Using the command diff helped narrowing down the pieces of code that 
were changed from the old working version, wich made it easier to spot 
the mistake in the new code.

In the future it wil surely make it easier to know where the has been 
changed from one version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
more efficient programmer in the long term?
In case theres a huge error or want to return to a previous working 
version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google Docs does?
You are the one programming so you know best when is the best time to 
commit a new version of your file. Automatically saved version could be 
useful but they may save when the code does not make any sense or fail
saving when you made a major change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each
file separetely?
Usually projects involve an important amount of files, doing commits only
of a single file, which could be related or is related to another file(s),
may cause a mistake or error of versioning. Instead a complete commit of 
the project may be more useful in that case.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of 
files?
Git log lists all the commits made, alog with a small comment, which makes
it easier to track down what was done on each version. Git diff will help
getting exactly what lines of code were changed. Both instructions combined
are very userful.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
It'll make more confident to know that i can go back to a previous version
easily and be able to check where my mistakes were made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using 
Git for?
Coding projects mostly, build a code portfolio.
